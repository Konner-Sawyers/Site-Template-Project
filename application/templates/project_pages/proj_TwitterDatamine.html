    A data analysis project done in a small group of three over the course of a few months. Data was collected using an API and processed using in house Python programs to clean and analyze data.
    As project lead my job was to determine software requirements, APIs, project scope and checking code. The project resulted in successful discoveries which can be read down below in the report.
